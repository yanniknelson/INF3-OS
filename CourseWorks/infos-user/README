InfOS User-space Implementation
=========================================================================

The InfOS user-space implementation contains a number of simple programs to
run on top of the InfOS kernel.

When InfOS boots, it will start the shell, which allows you to launch other
programs.  You can even launch a new shell, within a shell.

The shell is very basic, and doesn't support path resolution, so you must
qualify every program you want to run with the full path.  All the programs
live in the /usr directory, so to run a program you would enter the following,
the '>' being the shell prompt:

   > /usr/ls

To view this README file inside InfOS (which you might be doing right now!)
execute the following command:

   > /usr/cat /usr/README
